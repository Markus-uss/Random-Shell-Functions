This is for a school assignment

Created 3 shell scripts that accomplish the following tasks:

 - Memory: Displays information on active processes based on given arguments.
 - Reminder: Creates/Deletes/Modifies a reminder message that prints on startup.
 - Trash: Creates a temporary trash folder and moves deleted files there instead of immediately deleting.
